/**
 * Calculates a freshness score based on how recently a job was posted
 * Score ranges from 0 to 1, with newer jobs getting higher scores
 * 
 * Scoring curve:
 * - 0 days: 1.0 (fresh)
 * - 7 days: 0.8
 * - 30 days: 0.4
 * - 90+ days: 0.15 (old)
 * 
 * Freshness score is intentionally compressed so it helps ranking without dominating it.
 * 
 * @param posted - The posting date as a string or Date object
 * @returns A score between 0 and 1
